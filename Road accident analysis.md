## Introduction

Road accidents are a major public health concern, causing significant loss of life and injuries. Understanding the factors that contribute to road accidents is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies. This project aims to analyze road accident data using Power BI to identify patterns, trends, and factors that contribute to road accidents.

## Data

The data for this project was obtained from : (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1po_7QivCqGceixWVXCoX_ftzf8scG-sl/edit?usp=drive_link) dataset, which contains information on road accidents worldwide. The data includes details such as accident location, date, time, vehicle types involved, and weather conditions.

## Analysis

The data was analyzed using Power BI, a data visualization and analytics tool. Power BI was used to create various visualizations, including charts, maps, and tables, to explore the data and identify patterns and trends.

## Findings

The analysis revealed several key findings, including:

* The number of road accidents has been increasing in recent years.
* The most common causes of road accidents.
* Road accidents are more likely to occur in urban and rular areas.
* Finding the total casualties and  total accidents by location. 

## Recommendations

Based on the findings of the analysis, the following recommendations are made:

* Implement stricter enforcement of traffic laws, particularly for speeding, drunk driving, and distracted driving.
* Invest in road safety infrastructure, such as improved signage, lighting, and road conditions.
* Raise public awareness about road safety and promote responsible driving behaviors.
* Conduct further research to identify specific factors that contribute to road accidents in different regions and demographics.

## Conclusion

This project has demonstrated the power of data analysis to identify patterns, trends, and factors that contribute to road accidents. The findings of this project can be used to inform road safety policy and interventions to reduce the number of road accidents and save lives.
